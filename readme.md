# Speedy Delivieres

This is a parcel moving game created in 72h for Ludum Dare 54 using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
with [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/).

## Getting started

You will need to install [node](https://nodejs.org) including [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
Some IDE supporting TypeScript, e.g. `VS Code`, is also a good idea.

Once finished installing the development enviroment install project-specific dependencies with `npm install`.
Then start the development server with `npm start`. This should compile the project and open a browser serving
the current state of the project continiously, even when you change the source code.
